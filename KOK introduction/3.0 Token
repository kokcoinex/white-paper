There are three basic stages in the block chain:

Block chain 1 era, electronic money. The electronic currency stage can be the simplest centralization transaction.

The 2 era of block chain is the time we are in. The most important thing is the intelligent contract, digital asset and all kinds of commercial applications, including authentication and payment.

The 3 era of block chain is a completely centralization of social network which we hope to form in the future. If we can reach this point, it means that we can form a social trust relationship at a very low cost, so that the cost of the whole society will be greatly reduced.

Block chain 3.0:Token the economic subversion of business lies in its transformation of production relations:

Block chain 2 constructs the infrastructure of digital identity and intelligent contract. On this basis, the complexity of the underlying technology is hidden, and the application developers can focus more on the application logic and the business logic level. That is, when we enter the 3 era of block chain, the symbol is the emergence of Token. Token is a value transfer carrier on block chain network, and it can also be understood as a pass or token. Unlike traditional joint-stock companies, the shareholding companies take profits as the benchmark, while Token takes circulation efficiency as a benchmark, and the deeper one is based on influence as a benchmark, and the greater the influence, the more powerful the applicable ecology of Token is, thus ensuring good circulation efficiency.

The biggest role of Token for human society is its change in the relationship of production, the joint-stock company will be replaced, and every actual participant is the owner of the production capital. This new production relationship encourages every participant to contribute continuously to their productive forces, which is a great liberation of productivity. If this business activity is mapped into the inflation of real society, as long as the former outperforms the latter, every Token holder will gain profits over time.

In short, at present, the most important thing for Token is to do well in ecological construction, first of all, landing scenes. Although the enthusiasm of "block chain +" is high, the real application to the "block chain +" scenario is still limited. We think at least three points: the scene needs a Book (not limited to record value); there is a real appeal; a large consensus needs to be formed.
