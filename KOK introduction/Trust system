 "Trust chain BCB" and trust
 
 "Letter chain BCB" constructs a distributed and integrated trust system that integrates the diversity of trust in an integrated protocol system, integrates distributed multi-dimensional entity authentication system, various block chain systems and information systems, and integrates multi source identity authentication and multi source information exchange protocols, and provides different distributed responses.
 
 The distributed point to point trust system is realized by the open base module of the scene, and the distributed trust system of cross - chain, cross - system, cross - industry, cross - Application and cross - terminal is built.
 
 On the basis of distributed entity and data trust, "message chain BCB" puts forward the ecological and application of further expansion, extending the application of trust to many dimensions, from entity authentication to data exchange, from distributed process to distributed community, from distributed transaction to distributed reputation, and distributed account based on the underlying block chain.
 
 The system, together with various service partners, provides a variety of trust services in different regions and fields, and forms a part of the new generation of global trust network infrastructure.
